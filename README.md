Weather Application - FreeCodeCamp project - made using Dark Sky API

This is another project from a FreeCodeCamp website which utilizes Ajax methods. This is my first project in which I used Sass to modulirize and write my CSS, even though the CSS is very small. The design is very minimalistic and influenced by other mobile weather applications.

I used vanilla Javascript to make API calls to Google Geocode API and Dark Sky API.

Resources used:

  - SKYCONS - icons to provide visual represantation of weather data
  - PEXEL images - free background images to represent different weather data 
  
  The application is made with main intent to be used in a full-screen mobile version in portrait orientation, similar to how mobile weather applications are used.

To-do:

  - Needs to include better error handling to show an error message on screen if there is a problem with loading data.
  - Font color on different backgrounds changes accordingly either to white or black. This still might need updating for better UX.
  **Optional** - include an option to change between F and C degrees.
